If you lose your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup, you can recover the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup using the data available in the ONTAP volume data.
When you lose the setup, bring down the setup gracefully.

[NOTE]
You cannot recover your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup if there are issues with vCenter Server or ONTAP data management software. 

*Steps*

. Log in to the vSphere server.
. Navigate to the resource pool that you have created or to the node cluster or the host where you want to deploy the OVA.
. Right-click the required location and select *Deploy OVF template*.
. Select the OVA file either through the URL for the _.ova_ file or browse to the folder where the _.ova_ file is saved, and then click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
You should use the same OVA build that you used for installing the recovery setup.
. Select a name and folder for the virtual machine and select *Next*.
. Select the host and select *Next*.
. Review the summary of the template and select *Next*.
. Read and accept the license agreement and select *Next*.
. In the *Configuration* window, select *Recovery* option.
. In the *Select storage* window, select the storage for the configurations and disk files.
. In the *Select networks* window, select a destination network for each source network.
[NOTE]
You need to retain the load balancer IP address and the Kubernetes API Server IP address. You can change the node IP address or you can retain the same IP address.
. Select *Customize template* > *system configuration* window. Enter the following details:

Enter the following details:

.. Administrator username and password
.. Maintenance console password
.. VASA provider/SRA user name and password
.. ONTAP tools IP address
.. Node Interconnect IP address
.. NTP server
.. Enable AutoSupport
.. AutoSupport proxy URL
. (For HA deployment only) Select *Customize template* > *External storage configuration* window.
+
Enter the following details

.. Select the Protocol type.
.. Enter the ONTAP cluster management IP address in the *ONTAP management LIF* field.
.. Enter the ONTAP cluster data LIF in the *ONTAP data LIF* field. The data LIF should belong to the protocol selected. For example, if iSCSI protocol selected, then an iSCSI data LIF should be provided.
.. For Storage VM, you can choose to provide your ONTAP’s default storage VM details or create a new storage VM. Do not enter the value in *Storage VM* field when Enable SVM scoping is selected as this field is ignored.
.. Enter ONTAP user name and password.
.. Select *Enable SVM scoping* option if you intend to use the directly added SVM user account. To use ONTAP cluster, do not select the checkbox.
[NOTE]
When SVM scope is enabled you should have already enabled SVM support with management IP address.  
. In the case of HA-deployment recovery, provide the following details:
.. Content library details.
.. vCenter configuration details.
. In *Customize template* > *Node Configuration* window, enter the details as per the set up you're trying to recover, non-HA or HA setup.
. Review the details in the *Ready to complete* window, select *Finish*.
+
As the deployment task gets created, the progress is shown in the vSphere task bar.
. Power on the VM after the completion of the task.
+
The installation begins. You can track the installation progress in VM’s web console.
As part of the installation, node configurations are validated. The inputs provided under different sections under the Customize template in the OVF form are validated. In case of any discrepancies, a dialog prompts you to take corrective action.
. Make necessary changes in the dialog prompt. Use tab button to navigate across the panel and select *OK*.
+
On selecting *OK*, the values provided is validated again. ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere allows you three attempts to correct any invalid values. If you are unable  to correct issues after three attempts, the product installation stops and you are advised to try the installation on a fresh VM. 

After successful installation, the web console shows the state of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. 

After successful installation, you should manually edit the hardware requirements as per the guidelines in the link:../deploy/sizing-requirements.html[Prerequisites for deploying ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere] page.
