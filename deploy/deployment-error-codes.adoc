This page outlines the error codes for the deployment, reboot, upgrade, and recovery operations of our system. 
The error codes are five digits long, where the first two digits represent the script that encountered the issue, and the last three digits represent the specific workflow within that script.

All error logs are recorded in the ansible-perl-errors.log file to facilitate easy tracking and resolution of issues. This log file contains the error code as well as the particular ansible task which has failed.

The following table list the error codes and the corresponding file names.
