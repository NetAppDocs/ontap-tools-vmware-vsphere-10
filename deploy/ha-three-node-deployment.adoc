You can configure HA three nodes in either small, medium, or large configurations. HA deployment uses Trident to store the services data.

* Small HA three nodes contain 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM per node.
* Medium HA three nodes contain 12 CPUs and 24 GB RAM per node.
* Large HA three nodes contain 16 CPUs and 32 GB RAM per node.

*Before you begin*

This task gives you instructions on how to install HA three nodes in small, medium, or high configurations.

Creating the content library is a mandatory prerequisite step for deploying HA three nodes configuration.
A content library in VMware is a container object which stores VM templates, vApp templates, and other types of files. Deployment with content library provides you with a seamless experience as it is not dependent on the network connectivity.
[NOTE]
You should store the content library on a shared datastore, such that all hosts in a cluster can access it.
You need to create a content library to store the OVA before deploying the OVA in HA configuration.
[NOTE]
Content library template once uploaded should not be deleted post deployment, as it will be used during reboots.

Create the content library using the following steps:

. Download the `.zip` file that contains binaries (_.ova_) and signed certificates for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Log in to the vSphere client using `\https://vcenterip/ui`
. Select the horizontal ellipses next to vSphere client and select *Content library*.
. Select *Create* on the right of the page.
. Provide a name for the library and create the content library.
. Navigate to the content library you created.
. Select *Actions* in the right of the page and select *Import item* and import the OVA file.

[NOTE]
For more information, refer to https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/01/creating-and-using-content-library.html[Creating and Using Content Library] blog.

Make sure you have imported your OVA into your content library. Keep the name of the content library and the library item name that you have given to your OVA item handy.

[NOTE]
Before proceeding with the deployment, set the cluster's Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) on the inventory to 'Conservative' during the installation of ONTAP tools. This ensures that VM's do not migrate during the installation.

*Steps*

. Download the `.zip` file that contains binaries (_.ova_) and signed certificates for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Log in to the vSphere server.
. Navigate to the resource pool that you have created or to the cluster or to the host where you want to deploy the OVA.
. Right-click the required location and select *Deploy OVF template...*.
[NOTE]
Do not deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere virtual machine on a vVols datastore that it manages.
. Select the OVA file either through the URL for the _.ova_ file or browse to the folder where the _.ova_ file is saved, and then click *Next*.
. To deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from content library:
.. Go to your content library and click on the library item that you want to deploy. 
.. Click on *Actions* > *New VM from this template*
. Select a computer resource and click *Next*.
. Review the details of the template and click *Next*.
. Read and accept the license agreement and click *Next*.
. Select the deployment configuration and click *Next*.
. Select the storage for the configuration and the disk files and click *Next*.
. Select the destination network for each source network and click *Next*.
. In the *Customize template* window, fill in the required fields and click *Next*. 
[NOTE] 
* When SVM scope is enabled you should have already enabled SVM support with management IP address.  
* The information provided here is validated for proper patterns during installation process. In case of discrepancy, an error message is displayed on the web console, and you are prompted to correct any incorrect information provided.
* Host names must consist of uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), or the hyphen (-) special character. If you want to configure dual stack, specify the host name mapped to IPv6 address.
[NOTE]
Pure IPV6 is not supported. Mixed mode is supported with VLAN having both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.

. Review the details in the *Ready to complete* window, select *Finish*.
+
As the deployment task gets created, the progress is shown in the vSphere task bar.
. Power on the VM after the completion of the task.
+
The installation begins. You can track the installation progress in VMâ€™s web console.
As part of the installation, node configurations are validated. The inputs provided under different sections under the Customize template in the OVF form are validated. In the case of any discrepancies, a dialog prompts you to take corrective action.
. Make necessary changes in the dialog prompt. Use tab button to navigate across the panel and select *OK*.
+
The values provided are validated again. ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere allows you three attempts to correct any invalid values. If you are unable  to correct issues after three attempts, the product installation stops and you are advised to try the installation on a fresh VM. 

After successful installation, the web console shows the state of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
