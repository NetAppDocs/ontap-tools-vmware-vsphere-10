Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Plan your deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]

Check the Interoperability Matrix Tool(IMT) to ensure your deployment has been certified. Determine the size and type of ONTAP tools configuration for your environment and open the required ports in your network firewall.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small sized single node with core services to support NFS/VMFS datastores.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To use vVols, enable the VASA service and enable high availability with the two optional IP addresses. Enable the SRA services to use ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR).

If you're using vVols with multiple vCenter Severs, upgrade the self-signed certificate to certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.

Onboard ONTAP clusters directly in ONTAP tools vCenter UI. 
Alternatively, you can add SVMs directly when not utilizing vVols.

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere is a multi-tenant system that can manage multiple vCenter Server instances. ONTAP tools Manager provides more control to the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere administrator over the managed vCenter Server instances and onboarded storage backends.
