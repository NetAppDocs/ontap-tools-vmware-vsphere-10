[.lead]
Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps. This quick start takes you through the initial setup of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. When you’re done, you can optimize storage efficiency, simplify management, and enhance data protection and disaster recovery. 

If you’re planning to use vVols, expand your initial setup to HA configuration. For more information, refer to the link:../deploy/ha-workflow.html[HA deployment workflow].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Verify that your vSphere, ONTAP, and ESXi host versions are compatible with the ONTP tools version. Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space. Depending on your security policies, you may need to configure firewalls or other security appliances to allow network traffic.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure the vCenter Server is installed and accessible.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Initially, you'll deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small-sized single node configuration that provides core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores.
If you need to expand your configuration to use vVols datastore and high availability (HA), you’ll do so after you finish this workflow. During the deployment process, ensure that CPU hot add and memory hot plug options are enabled to facilitate scalability.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Add the vCenter Server
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add vCenter Server instances to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to configure, manage, and protect your virtual datastores in your vCenter Server environment.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Configure ONTAP user roles and privileges
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure new user roles and privileges for managing storage backends using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere and the ONTAP System Manager.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Configure the storage backends
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add storage backend to an ONTAP cluster. For multitenancy setups where vCenter acts as the tenant with associated SVM, use ONTAP tools Manager to add the cluster. Associate the storage backend with the vCenter Server to map it globally to the onboarded vCenter Server instance.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To add a local storage backend, use the ONTAP tools plug-in on the vCenter server.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When working with multiple vCenter Servers, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-7.png[Seven] (Optional) Enable SRA protection
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable the SRA capability to configure disaster recovery and protect NFS or VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-8.png[eight] (Optional) Enable SMas protection
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to manage host cluster protection for SnapMirror active sync (SMas). Pair the source and destination clusters and SVM for SMas. This applies only to VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-9.png[Nine] Backup and recover
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Schedule backups of your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup that you can use to recover the setup in case of a failure.
