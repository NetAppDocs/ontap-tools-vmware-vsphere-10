Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Plan your deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure your vSphere version, ONTAP version, and ESXi host version is compatible with the ONTP tools version. Allocate sufficent CPU, memory, and disk space. Depending on your security policies, you may need to configure firewalls or other security appliances to permit the traffic within your network.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure you have access to vCenter Server. Ensure VMware vSphere web client is installed and accessible.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You initially deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere in a small-sized single node that provides you with core services that enable support for NFS, VMFS, and vVols datastores.
If you need to expand your configuration so that you can use vVols and high availability (HA). Youâ€™ll expand your configuration after you finish this workflow.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Enable protection
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Onboard the clusters directly in the vSphere client user interface. Enable the SRA capability to configure disaster recovery and to protect NFS or VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Configure ONTAP user roles and privileges
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure new user roles and privileges for managing storage backends using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere and ONTAP System Manager.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Configure storage backends and vCenter Server
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add storage backend to onboard an ONTAP cluster. Add a storage backend to a globally scoped cluster using the ONTAP tools Manager. Add a storage backend to a locally scoped cluster using the ONTAP tools plug-in. Associate a storage backend with the vCenter Server to create a mapping between the storage backend and the onboarded vCenter Server instance globally.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Backup and recover
[role="quick-margin-para"]
As ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 uses dynamic storage provisioner, you cannot achieve zero-RPO. However, you can achieve near zero-RPO. To achieve near zero-RPO, create a backup of the setup. You can restore it on a new virtual machine.
Set up backup intervals. Schedule backups during periods of low activity to minimize the impact on the production systems.

== High availability(HA) deployment workflow

If you're planning to use vVols datastore, configure the ONTAP tools for Vmware vSphere to High availability(HA) deployment.
To use the HA features, enable the VASA Provider services.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Scale up the deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can scale up the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere configuration to increase the number of nodes in the deployment and change the configuration to High Availability (HA) setup.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Enable services

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To configure vVols datastore and to enable high availability (HA), you need to enable VASA Provider service and HA with the two optional IP addresses. 
Register the VASA provider with vCenter, and ensure storage policies meet HA requirements, including proper network and storage configurations. 
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable the SRA services to use ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR).

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Upgrade the certificates
[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you're using vVols with multiple vCenter Severs, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.
