Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Plan your deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]

Check the Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) to ensure your deployment has been certified. Determine the size and type of ONTAP tools configuration for your environment and open the required ports in your network firewall.  

Determine if you will be using multi-tenant SVMs or allow full cluster access. If using multi-tenant SVMs, you will need to have an SVM management LIF on each SVM to be used. This LIF must be reachable over port 443 by ONTAP tools.

Determine if you will be using the ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or Live Site Recovery (VLSR). If so, you will need to access to the SRM/VLSR server management interface to install the SRA.

If you will be using SnapMirror replication managed by ONTAP tools (including, but not limited to, SnapMirror active sync) then your ONTAP administrator must https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/create-cluster-relationship-93-later-task.html[create a cluster peer relationship in ONTAP] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/create-intercluster-svm-peer-relationship-93-later-task.html[create an intercluster SVM peer relationship in ONTAP] before you can use ONTAP tools with SnapMirror.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Provision IP Addresses and DNS records 
Request the following IP information from your network team. The first three IP addresses are required; node two and node three are used for scale-out high availability (HA) deployments. DNS host records are required and all IP addresses should be on the same VLAN.

❏ ONTAP tools application address

❏ Internal Services address 

❏ Node one's DNS hostname

❏ Node one's IP address

❏ Subnet mask

❏ Default gateway

❏ DNS server 1

❏ DNS server 2 

❏ DNS search domain 

❏ Node two's DNS hostname(optional) 

❏ Node two's IP address(optional) 

❏ Node three's DNS hostname(optional) 

❏ Node three's IP address(optional)

❏ Create DNS records for all IP addresses above.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small-sized single node with core services to support NFS/VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Configure your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To use vVols, enable the VASA service and high availability with the two optional IP addresses. Enable the SRA services to use ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR).
[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you're using vVols with multiple vCenter Severs, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.
