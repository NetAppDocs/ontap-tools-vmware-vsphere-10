Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Plan your deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]

Check the Interoperability Matrix Tool(IMT) to ensure your deployment has been certified. Determine the size and type of ONTAP tools configuration for your environment and open the required ports in your network firewall.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small sized single node with core services to support NFS/VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Configure your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To use vVols, enable the VASA service and enable high availability with the two optional IP addresses. Enable the SRA services to use ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR).
[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you're using vVols with multiple vCenter Severs, upgrade the self-signed certificate to certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.

Onborad the clusters in ONTAP tools manager or onboard the SVM using vSphere client user interface.
*  If not using multi-tenant SVMs then onboard clusters directly in ONTAP tools vCenter UI. Alternatively, in this scenario, it is possible to add SVMs directly when not utilizing vVols.
*  If you enabled SRA for SRM/VLSR to protect traditional datastores, link:../protect/configure-on-srm-appliance.html[Configure SRA on VMware Live Site Recovery appliance].
* Configure native backups for link:../manage/enable-backup.html[Near zero-RPO].
* Configure regular backups to other storage media.
