Getting started with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Plan your deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Verify that your vSphere, ONTAP, and ESXi host versions are compatible with the ONTP tools version. Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space. Depending on your security policies, you may need to configure firewalls or other security appliances to allow network traffic.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Make sure you have access to the vCenter Server and that the VMware vSphere web client is installed and accessible.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Initially, you'll deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere as a small-sized single node that provides core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores.
If you need to expand your configuration to use vVols datastore and high availability (HA), youâ€™ll do so after you finish this workflow.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Configure vCenter Server and storage backends
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add vCenter Server instances to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to configure, manage, and protect your virtual datastores in your vCenter Server environment. Add storage backend to an ONTAP cluster:
[role="quick-margin-list"]
* For a global cluster, use ONTAP tools Manager.
* For a local cluster, use ONTAP tools plug-in.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Associate the storage backend with the vCenter Server to map it globally to the onboarded vCenter Server instance.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Upgrade the certificates
[role="quick-margin-para"]
When working with multiple vCenter Servers, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Configure ONTAP user roles and privileges
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure new user roles and privileges for managing storage backends using the JSON file provided with ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere and the ONTAP System Manager.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] (Optional) Enable protection
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Configure ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to manage host cluster protection. Enable the SRA capability to configure disaster recovery and protect NFS or VMFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-7.png[Seven] Backup and recover
[role="quick-margin-para"]
As ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 uses a dynamic storage provisioner, you cannot achieve zero RPO. However, you can achieve near zero RPO. To achieve near zero RPO, create a backup of the setup. You can restore it on a new virtual machine. Set up backup intervals. Schedule backups during periods of low activity to minimize the impact on the production systems.

== High availability(HA) deployment workflow

If you plan to use vVols datastores, configure the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to high-availability (HA) deployment and enable the VASA Provider services.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Scale up the deployment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can scale up the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere configuration to increase the number of nodes in the deployment and change the configuration to an HA setup.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Enable services

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To configure the vVols datastore and enable HA, you must enable the VASA Provider service and HA with the two optional IP addresses. 
Register the VASA provider with vCenter and ensure storage policies meet HA requirements, including proper network and storage configurations. 
[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable the SRA services to use ONTAP tools Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) for VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) or VMware Live Site Recovery (VLSR).

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Upgrade the certificates
[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you're using vVol datastores with multiple vCenter Severs, upgrade the self-signed certificate to a certificate authority (CA) signed certificate.
