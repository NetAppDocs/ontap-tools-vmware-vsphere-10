The following section describes the key concepts and terms used in the document. 

|===

|*Terms* |*Description*

|VASA |VMware vSphere APIs for Storage Awareness (VASA) make it easy for a VM administrator to use whatever storage capabilities are needed to provision VMs without having to interact with their storage team. This is the software component that handles communication between VMware vSphere and the storage system. VASA Provider embedded within ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere uses VASA to improve storage management between Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere and the vCenter Server.

|OVA |Open Virtual Appliance

|vVols |Virtual volumes (vVols) are the actual virtual machine files and disks stored in the vVols datastore. Using the term vVol (singular) is referring to a single specific file, LUN, or namespace. 

|vVols datastore | The Virtual Volume datastore is a logical datastore representation of a vVols container which is created and maintained by a VASA Provider.  

|SRA |Storage Replication Adapter (SRA) is an implementation of SRA specifications provided by the storage vendors and implements an interface called the SRA interface. The adapter enables communication between Site Recovery Manager and a storage controller at the Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) level as well as at the cluster level configuration.

|SRM |VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) provides business continuity, disaster recovery, site migration, and nondisruptive testing capabilities for VMware virtual environments.

|HA |Cluster nodes are configured in High Availability (HA) pairs for nondisruptive operations.

|CA |Certificate authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.

|VAAI |VMware vSphere APIs for Array Integration. VAAI is a set of APIs that enable communication between VMware vSphere ESXi hosts and storage devices. 

|iSCSI |iSCSI is a block protocol that can run on standard Ethernet networks. 

|VM Storage Policy | VM Storage Policies are created in vCenter under Policies and Profiles. For vVols, create a rule set using rules from the NetApp vVols storage type provider.

|NFS |Network File System (NFS) is an open IETF standard defined in Request for Comments (RFC) that allows anyone to implement the protocol.

|SVM |Like a virtual machine running on a hypervisor, storage virtual machine (SVM) is a logical entity that abstracts physical resources. SVM contains data volumes and one or more LIFs through which they serve data to the clients. 

|VMFS |Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) is a clustered file system specifically designed for storing virtual machine files in VMware vSphere environments.
