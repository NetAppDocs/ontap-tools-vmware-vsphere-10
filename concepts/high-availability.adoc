ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere supports a high-availability (HA) configuration to help provide uninterrupted functionality of ONTAP tools during failure.

High-availability (HA) solution provides for rapid recovery from outages caused by:

* Host failure
+
[NOTE]
Only single node failure is supported.
* Network failure
* Virtual machine failure (Guest OS failure)
* Application (ONTAP tools) crash

No additional configuration is required for ONTAP tools to provide high-availability (HA).

NOTE: ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere does not support vCenter HA.
