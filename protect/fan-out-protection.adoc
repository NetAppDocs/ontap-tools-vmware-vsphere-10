[.lead]
In a fan-out protection scenario, the consistency group is double protected with synchronous relationship on the first destination ONTAP cluster and with asynchronous relationship on the second destination ONTAP cluster. 
The create, edit, and delete SnapMirror active sync protection workflows maintain the synchronous protection. VMware Live Site Recovery appliance failover and reprotect workflows maintain the asynchronous protection. 

[NOTE]
Fan-out is not supported for SVM user.
// OTVDOC-317 - jani

To set up fan-out protection, peer the three site clusters and SVMs. 

Example:
|===
|If |then
a|
* Source consistency group is on cluster c1 and SVM svm1
* First destination consistency group is on cluster c2 and SVM svm2 and
* Second destination consistency group is on cluster c3 and SVM svm3

a|
* The cluster peering on source ONTAP cluster will be (C1, C2) and (C1, C3). 
* The cluster peering on first destination ONTAP cluster will be (C2, C1) and (C2, C3) and 
* The cluster peering on second destination ONTAP cluster will be (C3, C1) and (C3, C2). 
* SVM peering on source SVM will be (svm1, svm2) and (svm1, svm3). 
* SVM peering on first destination SVM will be (svm2, svm1) and (svm2, svm3) and 
* SVM peering on second destination svm will be (svm3, svm1) and (svm3, svm2).

.Steps

. Select a new place holder datastore. The placeholder datastore selection criteria for phased protection are:
* Do not place the placeholder datastore in the host cluster you are protecting.
* If you need to include the placeholder datastore in the host cluster, add it to VMware Live Site Recovery appliance before setting up SnapMirror active sync protection. With this setup, you can leave the placeholder datastore out of protection.

. Add datastore to the host cluster protection by following link:../manage/edit-hostcluster-protection.html[Modify protected host cluster]. Add both asynchronous and synchronous policy types.
