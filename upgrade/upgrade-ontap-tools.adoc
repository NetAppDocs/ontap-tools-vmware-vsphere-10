[.lead]
You can upgrade from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 or 10.4 to 10.5. However, to upgrade from ONTAP tools 10.0, 10.1, or 10.2 to 10.5, you must first upgrade to 10.3 or 10.4 before proceeding to 10.5.

NOTE:

* For ASA r2 systems, make sure you upgrade to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to 10.5 and ONTAP to 9.16.1, before setting up more storage availability zones (SAZs).
// https://jira.ngage.netapp.com/browse/OTVDOC-254 updates
* If the upgrade from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 or 10.4 to 10.5 fails, you can not roll back. Use low RPO or snapshot recovery to restore the setup. For ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.2 and earlier, use zero-RPO to restore the setup.

.Before you begin

* Ensure the ONTAP system certificate and onboarded vCenter certificates are valid for at least 5 days. If it expires sooner, the upgrade fails.
* To ensure a secure upgrade, verify that your certificates include Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries. If your certificates lack SAN entries and you need to proceed with the upgrade, you can set the certificate validation flag to false to bypass SAN checks in prompt during upgrade.
// 10.5 updates - Jani certificate feature.
* Ensure you have a fifth disk with a capacity of 100 GB on all nodes.
* Verify that the node configuration matches the specifications in the table below.

* Ensure hot plug-in for CPU and RAM is enabled.
* For ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 or 10.4 deployment, take a quiesced snapshot on the ONTAP tools virtual machine before upgrading.
* Enable low RPO backup and ensure one backup visible in vCenter Client interface.

During the upgrade, if any onboarded storage backend certificates are missing Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries, you will receive a prompt indicating the missing SAN. If you choose to proceed without validating the SAN, the upgrade will continue, but this is not recommended because of potential security risks.
. When you upgrade, the following actions are performed automatically:
.. The gateway certificate is renewed with a 1-year validity period. When you remove the previous SRA adapter and upload the new 10.5 adapter, the SRA certificate validity changes from 10 years to 1 year.
.. Remote plug-in is upgraded
.. ONTAP and vCenter Server certificates are validated and added to ONTAP tools
.. Backup is enabled

.What's next

After upgrading to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.5:
* Monitor system alerts and plan to renew the gateway certificate before it expires in one year.
* Remove the ONTAP tools 10.4 or 10.3 SRA adapter and upload the 10.5 SRA adapter tar file. Then, rescan the SRA adapters to update the VMware Site Recovery Storage Replication Adapters page.

After upgrading you can: 

* Disable the services from the manager user interface
* Move from a non-HA setup to an HA setup
* Scale up a non-HA small configuration to a non-HA medium, or to an HA medium or large configuration.
