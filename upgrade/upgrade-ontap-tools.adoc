[NOTE]
Upgrade is supported from ONTAP tools for VM ware vSphere 10.1 and 10.2 versions to 10.3 version. Upgrade from ONTAP tools 10.0 version to 10.3 version is not supported.

*Before you begin*

If the appliance was deployed as local-path (easy- deployment) with ONTAP tools 10.1 or 10.2 version, you need to take quiesce snapshot before upgrading.

If you're upgrading from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.0 to 10.1, you need to complete the following steps before proceeding with the upgrade task:

*Enable Diagnostics*

. From vCenter Server, open a console to ONTAP tools.
. Log in as the maintenance user.
. Enter *4* to select Support and Diagnostics.
. Enter *2* to select Enable remote diagnostic access.

. Enter *y* to set the password of your choice.
. Log in to the VM IP address from the terminal/putty with user as 'diag' and password that was set in the previous step.

*Take Backup of MongoDB*

Run the following commands to take a backup of mongoDB:

* kn exec -it ntv-mongodb-0 sh - kn is an alias of kubectl -n ntv-system.
* env | grep MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD - run this command inside the pod.
* 'exit' - run this to come out of the pod.
* kn exec ntv-mongodb-0 --mongodump -u root -p MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --archive=/tmp/mongodb-backup.gz --gzip - run this command to replace MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD set from above command.
* kn cp ntv-mongodb-0:/tmp/mongodb-backup.gz ./mongodb-backup.gz - run this command to copy the mongodb backup created using above command from pod to host.

*Take the quaise snapshot of all the volumes*

* Run 'kn get pvc' command and save the output of the command.
* Take snapshots of all the volumes one by one using one of the following methods:
** From CLI, run the command _volume snapshot create -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -snapshot <snapshot_name>_
** From ONTAP system manager user interface search the volume by its name in the search bar then open that volume by clicking on the name. Go to snapshot and add the snapshot of that volume.

*Take the snapshot of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere VMs in vCenter (3VMs in case of HA Deployment, 1 VM in case of non-HA deployment)*

* In the vSphere client user interface, select the VM.
* Go to the snapshots tab and click the *Take Snapshot* button. Take a quiesced snapshot of the VM. Refer to https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-9720B104-9875-4C2C-A878-F1C351A4F3D8.html[Take a Snapshot of a Virtual Machine^] for more details.

From the log bundle, delete the completed pods with prefix “generate-support-bundle-job” before performing the upgrade.
If support bundle generation is in progress, wait for it to complete and then delete the pod.

You need to add an additional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) of size 100GB for any type of upgrade. Perform the following task to add HDD.

. Select the VM in single node configuration or select all the three VMs in HA configuration.
. Right click on the VM(s) and select *Add New Device* > *Hard Disk*
. In the *New Hard disk* field, add HDD of 100 GB of size.
. Click *Apply*  

After adding the hard disk, update the the resources of the VM for the respective configurations and restart the primary VM.

A new HDD will be created. Dynamic storage provisioner uses this HDD to create or replicate the volumes.

*Steps*

. Upload ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere upgrade ISO to content library.
. In the primary VM page, select *Actions* > *Edit Settings* 
. In the edit settings window under *CD/DVD drive* field, select content library ISO file. 
. Select the ISO file and click *OK*. Choose the connected checkbox across the *CD/DVD drive* field.

After upgrading to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3, you can: 

* Disable the services from manager UI
* Move from a non-HA set up to HA set up
* Scale up a non-HA small configuration to a non-HA medium or to a HA medium or large configuration.

*After you finish*

After you upgrade from previous releases of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere to 10.3 release, rescan the SRA adapters to verify that the details are updated on the VMware Live Site Recovery Storage Replication Adapters page.
