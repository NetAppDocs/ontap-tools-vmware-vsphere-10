[.lead]
You can upgrade from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 or 10.4 to 10.5. However, to upgrade from ONTAP tools 10.0, 10.1, or 10.2 to 10.5, you must first upgrade to 10.3 or 10.4 before proceeding to 10.5.

NOTE:

* For ASA r2 systems, make sure you upgrade to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.5 with ONTAP 9.16.1 before setting up more storage availability zones (SAZs).
// https://jira.ngage.netapp.com/browse/OTVDOC-254 updates
* If the upgrade from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.3 or 10.4 to 10.5 fails, you can not roll back. Use low RPO/snapshot recovery to restore the setup. For ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.2 and lower versions, you can restore the setup using the zero-RPO.

.Before you begin

* Ensure the ONTAP system certificate and onboarded vCenter certificates are valid for at least 5 days. If it expires sooner, the upgrade fails.
// 10.5 updates - Jani certificate feature.
* For a non-HA upgrade, power off the ONTAP tools VM, and for an HA upgrade, power off the first node before making the any changes to the virtual machine (VM) settings. 
* Ensure you add a fifth disk with a capacity of 100 GB.
* Verify that the node configuration matches the specifications in the table below.

* Ensure hot plug-in for CPU and RAM is enabled.
* In case of HA deployment, ensure there is 100 GB hard disks for the second and third nodes as well. You don't need to reboot these nodes.
* If the appliance is deployed using the local path (easy deployment) option in ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.2, take a quiesced snapshot before upgrading.
* Enable low RPO backup and ensure one backup visible in vCenter Client interface.

After upgrading you can: 

* Disable the services from the manager user interface
* Move from a non-HA setup to an HA setup
* Scale up a non-HA small configuration to a non-HA medium, or to an HA medium or large configuration.
* For a non-HA upgrade, reboot the ONTAP tools VM to show the changes. For an HA upgrade, reboot the first node to show the changes on the node.

After upgrading, manually delete the Trident volumes from ONTAP using the following procedure:

[NOTE]
These steps aren't required if the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.1 or 10.2 is in non-HA small or medium (local path) configurations.

. From the vCenter Server, open a console to ONTAP tools.
. Log in as the maintenance user.
