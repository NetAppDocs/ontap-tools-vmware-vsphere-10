You can filter jobs by time period, adjust page size, and view job details, including errors and sub-tasks. Click a failed status for error details. For jobs with sub-tasks, expand the row to view descriptions and statuses. For sub-jobs use the  job's drilldown to view the details.
* Download log bundles - Collect log files to troubleshoot ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
