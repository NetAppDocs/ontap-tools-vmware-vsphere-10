[.lead]
ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere supports multi-tenancy, enabling management of multiple vCenter Server instances. 
The ONTAP tools Manager is a web-based user interface that provides a centralized management console for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere. It allows administrators to manage the ONTAP tools appliance, vCenter Server instances, and storage backends effectively. It also allows administrators to manage the appliance configuration, such as enabling High Availability (HA) and scaling up node sizes.

ONTAP tools Manager provides the following capabilities:

* Manage vCenter Server instances - Add and manage vCenter Server instances within ONTAP tools.
* Manage storage backends - Add and manage ONTAP storage clusters, and map them to vCenter Server instances globally.
* Monitor jobs - Monitor and debug asynchronous jobs initiated from both the vCenters Client Plugin interface and ONTAP tools Manager interface. You can filter jobs by time period, adjust page size, and view job details, including errors and sub-tasks. Sub-jobs and their statuses are accessible through expandable rows and hyperlinks for deeper insight.
* Manage alerts - View and filter alerts generated by ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
* Download log bundles - Collect log files to troubleshoot ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.
* Manage certificates - Replace the self-signed certificate with a custom CA certificate, and renew or refresh certificates for VASA Provider and ONTAP tools.
* Reset passwords - Change the password for the VASA Provider and SRA.
* Manage appliance settings - Configure the ONTAP tools appliance, including enabling HA and scaling up node sizes.
