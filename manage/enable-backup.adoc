You need to take backup of the system before upgrading from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.1 and 10.2 to 10.3 release. You need to perform a backup and restore the data to the new machine to recover the setup.

.Steps

. From vCenter Server, open the maintenance console.
. Log in as the maintenance user.
. Enter `4` to select *Support and Diagnostics*.
. Enter `3` to select *Enable System Backup* option.
. In case of non-HA, enter the vCenter credentials where the ONTAP tools virtual machine is deployed.  
. Enter the backup frequency value between 5-60 mins.
. Press *Enter*

This procedure creates the backup and pushes the backup to the datastore of the virtual machine at a regular interval.
