Resizing a datastore enables you to increase the storage for your virtual machine files. You can change the size of a datastore as your infrastructure requirements change.

.About this task

You can increase the size of NFS and VMFS datastores. A FlexVol volume in these datastores cannot shrink below its current size but can grow up to 120%.

.Steps

. From the vSphere Client home page, select *Hosts and Clusters*.
. In the navigation pane, select the data center that contains the datastore.
. Right-click the NFS or VMFS datastore and select *NetApp ONTAP tools* > *Resize datastore*.
. In the Resize dialog box, enter a new size for the datastore and select *OK*.
