Unmount datastore action unmounts a NFS or VMFS datastore from ESXi hosts. Unmount datastore action is enabled for NFS and VMFS datastores that are discovered or managed by the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere.

*Steps*

. Log in to the vSphere client using `\https://vcenterip/ui`
. Right-click a NFS or VMFS datastore object, and then select *Unmount*.
+
A dialog box opens and lists the ESXi hosts that the datastore is mounted on. 
When the operation is performed on a protected datastore, a warning message is displayed on the screen.
. Select one or more ESXi hosts to unmount the datastore.
+
You cannot unmount the datastore from all hosts. The UI suggests that you use the delete datastore operation instead.
. Select the *Unmount* button.
+
If the datastore is part of a protected host cluster, a warning message is displayed. 
. Read the warning message and select the *I understand the risks* check-box, before selecting the *Unmount* option. 

You can track the progress in the Recent Task panel.
