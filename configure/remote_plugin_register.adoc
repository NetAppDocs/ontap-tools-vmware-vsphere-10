When you Add vCenter, ONTAP tools for VMware vCenter plug-in gets registered to the vCenter as a Remote plugin. The plug-in is visible on the vSphere user interface shortcuts.
 
The plugin is registered with a key _com.netapp.otv_ to the vCenter and can be seen in the ExtensionManager of the vCenter.
