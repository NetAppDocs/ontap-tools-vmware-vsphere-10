Adding storage backends to an ONTAP cluster improves scalability and performance. ONTAP tools let you provision and manage datastores directly from the vCenter Server.

To add storage backends locally, use cluster or SVM credentials in the ONTAP tools interface. These storage backends are accessible only to the selected vCenter Server. ONTAP tools maps associated SVMs to the vCenter Server for managing vVols or VMFS datastores. For VMFS datastore workflows, including SRA workflows, you can use SVM credentials without needing a globally mapped cluster.

You can add global storage backends, available only for ONTAP cluster credentials, using ONTAP tools Manager. These backends support discovery workflows that identify the essential cluster resources for vVol management. In multitenancy setup, global clusters allow a cluster to add an SVM user locally and manage vVols datastore.

When you enable MetroCluster support in the ONTAP system, onboard both source and destination clusters configured with MetroCluster as local or global storage backends.

.Before you begin
Before adding the storage backend to an ONTAP cluster, get the certificate from the ONTAP administrator. Ensure it is a valid certificate with the updated Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field. ONTAP systems require SAN fields in the certificate to identify the cluster and SVM management LIFs.

.Using ONTAP tools Manager
--

[NOTE]
In a multi-tenant setup, you can add a storage backend cluster globally and SVM locally to use SVM user credentials.

.Steps

. Launch ONTAP tools Manager from a web browser: `\https://<ONTAPtoolsIP>:8443/virtualization/ui/` 
. Log in with the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere administrator credentials you provided during deployment. 
. Select *Storage Backends* from the sidebar.
. Add the storage backend and provide the server IP address or FQDN, username, and password details.
[NOTE]
IPv4 and IPv6 address management LIFs are supported.
. In the advanced options, you can fetch the ONTAP cluster certificates automatically, which requires you to authorize the certificate or manually upload the certificate.
. If the added storage backend is part of the MetroCluster configuration, *Add MetroCluster peer* screen appears. Select *Add peer* to add the peer storage backend.
[NOTE]
After ONTAP systems perform a switchover, run the ONTAP tools discovery manually.

// 10.5 updates -Jani.

.Using vSphere client user interface
--

[NOTE]
vVols datastores do not support direct addition of an SVM user through the vSphere client user interface.

. Log in to the vSphere client.
. In the shortcuts page, select *NetApp ONTAP tools* under the plug-ins section.
. Select *Storage Backends* from the sidebar.
. Add the storage backend and provide the server IP address, username, password, and port details.
[NOTE]
To add an SVM user directly, you can add cluster-based credentials and IPv4 and IPv6 address management LIFs or provide SVM-based credentials with an SVM management LIF.
. In the advanced options, you can fetch the ONTAP cluster certificates automatically, which requires you to authorize the certificate or manually upload the certificate by browsing to its location. 
. If the added storage backend is part of the MetroCluster configuration, *Add MetroCluster peer* screen appears. Select *Add peer* to add the peer storage backend.
[NOTE]
After ONTAP systems perform a switchover, run the ONTAP tools discovery manually.

// 10.5 updates -Jani. For MCC and certificate feature updates.
.Whatâ€™s next?

ONTAP tools updates the list, and you see the new storage backend.

--
====

The *Storage backends* page lists the newly added storage backend. ONTAP tools shows a warning in the certificate expiry date column if a certificate will expire in 30 days or less. After the certificate expires, ONTAP tools show the storage backend as unknown because it lose communication with the storage system.
