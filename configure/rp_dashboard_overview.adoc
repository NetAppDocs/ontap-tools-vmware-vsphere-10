When you select NetApp ONTAP tools Plug-in icon in the shortcuts section on the vCenter client, the user interface navigates to *Overview* page. This page acts like the dashboard providing you the summary of the ONTAP tools plug-in.

In the case of Enhanced Linked Mode setup(ELM), the vCenter Server select dropdown appears and you can select a desired vCenter to see the data relevant to it. This dropdown is available for all the other listing views of the plugin. 
vCenter selection made in one page persists across the tabs of the plug-in.
