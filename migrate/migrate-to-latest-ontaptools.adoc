= Migrate from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.xx to 10.4

[.lead]
Moving the NetApp ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere setup from version 9.xx to 10.x necessitates a migration process because of the significant product updates and enhancements across the versions. 

You can migrate from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.12D1, 9.13D2, and 9.13P2 releases to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.4. 

//updated for OTVDOC-175 - jani

If you have NFS and VMFS datastores and no vVols datastores in your setup, simply uninstall ONTAP tools 9.xx and deploy ONTAP tools 10.x. However, if your setup contains vVols datastores, youâ€™ll have to go through a process of migrating the VASA Provider and the SRA.  

The following table outlines the migration process in these two different scenarios.

|*If the setup has vVols datastores* |*If the setup does not contain VMWare vVols datastores*

Steps:

1. Back up your ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.xx configuration. 
// You can use the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere CLI or REST API to export the configuration settings.

2. Remove ONTAP tools 9.xx from your environment. Refer to https://kb.netapp.com/data-mgmt/OTV/VSC_Kbs/OTV_How_to_remove_OTV_9_12_from_your_environment[How to remove OTV 9.12+ from your environment] NetApp Knowledge Base article.

[NOTE]
After migrating from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9.xx to 10.4, vVols datastores using the NVMe/FC protocol become non-operational because ONTAP tools 10.4 supports the NVMe-oF protocol only with VMFS datastores.
